# TicTacToe
## A Python class exercise
### Procedural Programming
First exercise: a procedural implementation

    $ python tictactoe_procedural.py

- Game Play (rules and turns)
- Player (opponents)

For extra credit:

Bonus must be done in this order for credit.  No skipping around.

- Bonus 1: Implement linting
- Bonus 2: Implemment unit testing and get code coverage as close to 100% as possible.
